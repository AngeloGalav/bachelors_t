# bachelors_t
The repository of my Bachelor of Science thesis. It contains the Latex code for both the presentation and the thesis itself.  

## About the code
You can find the first part of the actual thesis code @ the repository [NGINX-OPA-Authz](https://github.com/AngeloGalav/NGINX-OPA-Authz). 
The rest of the code (VOMS4NOA part + StoRM Tape integration) will be released once I'll make sure to clean the repos of all sensitive data.  

### Latex Template
The Latex template for the thesis text is heavily inspired by [Matteo Biondi's thesis](https://github.com/mattiabiondi/baccalaureus). Please, thank him on my behalf if you have the chance!
